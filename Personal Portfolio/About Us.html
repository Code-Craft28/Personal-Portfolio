         <h1>&#128187;ABOUT ME</h1>
         <p>Hello! I'm Coder of CodeCraft and I’m a passionate front-end developer with a strong<br> foundation in HTML and CSS. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly<br> websites that not only look good but also offer a great user experience    across all devices </p>
         <h1>&#128203;WHAT I DO</h1>
         <p>I craft clean, semantic, and well-structured code to turn designs into real, interactive web<br> pages. Whether it’s a personal portfolio, business landing page, or a simple UI component,<br> I focus on bringing ideas to life using just HTML and CSS — with a strong emphasis on<br> mobile-first design and accessibility.</p>
         <h1>&#128204;MY GOAL</h1>
         <p>My goal is to help individuals, startups, and businesses make a powerful online impression.<br> I believe in the importance of simplicity, speed, and usability when it comes to web design.</p>
         <h1>&#128205;WHY WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h1>
         <p>I enjoy problem-solving and seeing things take shape visually. Web development allows<br> me to be both creative and logical — to design how things look and how they work. I’m<br> always eager to explore new CSS tricks, layout techniques (like Flexbox and Grid), and best<br> practices for responsive design.</p>
         <h1>&#128221;CURRENTLY LEARNING</h1>
         <p>I am constantly growing my skills and soon plan to learn:<br>
         .JavaScript to add interactivity<br>
         .Git and GitHub for version control<br>
         .Basic SEO techniques<br>
         .Web accessibility and performance optimization<br></p>
         <h1>&#129309;LET'S WORK TOGETHER</h1>
         <p>If you're looking for a developer who’s passionate, detail-oriented, and always eager to<br> learn — I’d love to work on your next project. Let’s connect and bring your ideas to the<br> web!</p>
